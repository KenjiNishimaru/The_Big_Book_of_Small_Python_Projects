# The_Big_Book_of_Small_Python_Projects
81 practice programs

It's been a long time since I last programmed in Python, so I decided to practice syntax by reading this book.

3 steps I've decided to take to each project:
  - Read what the project is supossed to do
  - Implement by myself
  - Compare my answer with the book's answer

Project 1 - Bagels (Guessing Game - 3 digits)

Project 2 - Birthdays (Calculating % of 2 people make birthday at the same day)

Project 3 - Bitmap (printing world map with strings)

Project 4 - Blackjack 

Project 6 - Caesar Cipher (simple problem to shift letters by a certain quantity)

Project 7 - Caesar Hacker (shift all posibilities to decode a message)

Project 8 - Calendar Maker (choose a month and year, it will be displayed in the screen)

Project 10 - Chohan (old japanese gambling game)

Project 12 - Collatz Sequence (open math problem)
