the solution proposed by the book brings something interesting:

import datetime
randomNumberOfDays = datetime.timedelta(random.randint(0, 364))
birthday = startOfYear + randomNumberOfDays
birthdays.append(birthday)

you can add variables that represents a period of time.

The solution provided by the book is actually clever than mine, when checking if there is matches between birthdays.

Although both solutions are O(nÂ²)
